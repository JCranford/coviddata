# coviddata

This repository is designed simply as a holding tank for data files related to COVID that are not in my main working/coding repository.

## Opertions 2020-05-02

I have performed several tasks today for this repository, which is, essentially, just a place to store datafiles.

1. I transferred a large number of database files relating to Johns Hopkins data on COVID (which is largely redundant, each file containing ALL of the data in the previous file along with the latest 24 hours of data)
2. I transferred 'canpop.dta' the datafile with data about the population breakdown in Canada by province and territory
