# README.md for Worldometers data

One of the websites that is most frequently visited on the web (it seems) to get data about the ongoing status of the COVID-19 pandemic is that found at worldometers.com. It appears to be *very* complete, and its data sources are documented (largely).

I have taken to (episodically) capturing the data from their online displays in a LibreOffice spreadsheet (rather a *series* of spreadsheets) and those are stored in this subdirectory of my __github__ account.

The names of the spreadsheets are:

- CovidData.ods    (for *world* data)
- USData.ods      (for *US* data)
